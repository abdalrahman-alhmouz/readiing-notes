 1 - html
 
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
#### A Simple HTML Document

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
 ## Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
 
 ## HTML has six "levels" of headings:'<h1>' is used for main headings .
  - '<h2>' is used for subheadingsIf there are further sections under the subheadings then the .
  - '<h3>' element is used, and so
##  HtMl '<p>'To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up
 the paragraph with an opening '<p>'tag and closing '</p>' tag.
 ### As you have already seen, 
 the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line.
  - But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag "<br />".

 2 - css 
 ## CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
 * CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets .
 - fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
 - CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly,
-  CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
 - CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

 ## lits toak a little at java script :
 * scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage.
  - In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive,
  - with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.
  You should place all your JavaScript code within <script> tags (<script> and </script>) if you are keeping your JavaScript code within the HTML document itself. 
 - also you You should write comments to explain what your code does.
 - They help make your code easier to read and understand.
 - This can help you and others who read your code.

 *A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.
When you write JavaScript, you have to tell the
interpreter every individual step that you want it to
perform.
This sometimes involves more detail than
you might expect. 
 ## array :
 * You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.
 - Arrays are especially helpful
when you do not know how
many items a list will contain
because, when you create the
array, you do not need to specify
how many values it will hold.

 - as their name implies, allow you to compare two values.
 * some of them :

## loops :Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
