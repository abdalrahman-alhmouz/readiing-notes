 1 - html
 
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
#### A Simple HTML Document

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
 ## Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
 
 ## HTML has six "levels" of headings:'<h1>' is used for main headings .
  - '<h2>' is used for subheadingsIf there are further sections under the subheadings then the .
  - '<h3>' element is used, and so
##  HtMl '<p>'To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up
 the paragraph with an opening '<p>'tag and closing '</p>' tag.
 ### As you have already seen, 
 the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line.
  - But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag "<br />".
